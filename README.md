# **Graphical Calculator App**

## Overview
The Graphical Calculator App is a versatile calculator application built with React Native, designed for both educational and everyday use. This is a personal side project that aims to provide users with both a normal calculator for basic arithmetic operations and a graphical calculator for plotting equations and visualizing mathematical functions.

## Live Demo
You can also access a live demo of the app at [Expo Preview Link](https://expo.dev/preview/update?message=Graphing%20Feature&updateRuntimeVersion=1.0.0&createdAt=2024-08-29T16%3A25%3A09.680Z&slug=exp&projectId=f0bc4007-29d8-47f2-973c-fa5c885f4492&group=3cc05160-5e3c-4864-a95e-9ffc556825c3). 
This link provides access to the latest preview update of the app. You will need the Expo Go app to view it.
